Code 201: Foundations of Software Development

Week 1: Extra-credit option 1 (math-oriented):
Write HTML & JS such that the JS has two functions: An "outer" function A that accepts 3 parameters: a number "x0", a number "d", and a function P.  P is a polynomial function, such as P(x) = 3 x^3 - 2 x + 42. Function A will estimate (and return) the derivative of P at x0 , so derivative = ( P(x0+d) - P(x0) ) / d
